# Ravages
Ravages is an R package to perform rare variant association tests (RVAT) and genetic simulations

## Description
Ravages enables to perform rare variant association tests (burden and SKAT) with a multi-category, binary, and continuous phenotypes.
Ravages also enables to perform genetic simulations based on real data to mimic allele frequency spectrum and linkage disequilibrium pattern observed on these data.

## Installation
```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("genostats/Ravages")
```

## Usage
Please look at the <a href="doc/Ravages_vignette.pdf">vignette on RVAT</a> for an example of how to perform both burden and SKAT rare variant association tests.
Please look at the <a href="doc/Ravages_Simulations_vignette.pdf">vignette on simulations tests</a> for an example of how to perform genetic simulations with rare variants and how to compute power of RVAT using these simulations.
Please look at the <a href="doc/Ravages.pdf">Ravages user manual</a> for details about individual functions from Ravages.
