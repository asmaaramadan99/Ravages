v0.2.0 :
 - Analysis by CADD regions implemented:
    *File CADDRegions containing CADD regions and their associated median
    *File FunctionalAreas containing the positions of the three genomic areas (coding, intergenic, regulatory)
    *Variants can be annotated into these two types of regions (set.CADDregions)
    *Possilibity to annotate variants with the adjusted CADD score and to filter them based on the median observed in each CADD region (filter.adjustedCADD)
    *Possibility to perform burden tests with subscores in the regression to take into account the genomic areas (burden.subscores)

 - Parallelisation of burden on continuous phenotypes

 - get.effect.size replaces get.OR.values in burden() and enables to get the beta estimate for continuous phenotypes

 - Add the possibility to filter genomic regions based on the cumulative MAF (min.cumulative.maf)

 - Simulations: rbm.haplos.power() and random.bed.matrix.power() to directly compute power of CAST, WSS and SKAT on the corresponding simulations

v0.1.5:
 - Fix bugs with tinythreads and RcppParallel in SKAT

v0.1.2:
 - Parallelisation of SKAT on continuous phenotypes

 - Minor bugs corrected :
   - SKAT() with continuous phenotypes can be run only if at least 2 variants in the genomic region
   - Cleaning temporary files in functions called by mclapply to optimise memory usage

 - Checks added in multiple functions to verify the fit between functions and arguments
